/**
 * This is a Slide class which contains the title (String), the array of bullet points (String[]), 
 * and the duration of the slide in minutes (double). Each slide is limited to a maximum of 
 * 5 bullet points, which is reflected in a static constant named MAX_BULLETS. It also provides
 * getter and setter methods for all member variables, with the getter/setter method for bullets taking 
 * an additional index parameter (see the provided UML diagram for further detail). In addition, there contains
 * a constructor as detailed below. Lastly, there is  a toString() method that returns a 
 * printable representation of the Slide and itâ€™s data members (title, duration, and bullets).
