/**
 * This class named SlideList implements a double
 * linked-list data structure. The SlideList maintains a list of 
 * Slides by chaining a series of SlideListNodes between a head and a 
 * tail reference. In addition, a cursor is provided to allow a 
 * user to traverse the list, selecting individual SlideListNodes to allow 
 * for insertion, deletion, and manipulation of the Slides they contain. 
 * Lastly, the class provides methods to query information about the list,
 * such as itâ€™s size, the total duration of all Slides in the list, and the 
 * total bullet points of all Slides in the list.
