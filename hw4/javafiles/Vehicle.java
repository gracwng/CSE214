/**
 * This class represents a car which passes through the intersection. Each instance must contain the serialId 
 * (the first car to arrive at the intersection is serialId 1, the second car to arrive is serialId 2, the n'th 
 * car to arrive will have serialId >n) and the time it arrived (stored as an int). The car must be initialized 
 * with a serialId and the time it arrived. The serial counter is static and stores the number of vehicles that 
 * have arrived at the intersection so far. It is the only variable that is modifiable
 * 
 * The Vehicle class itself is actually immutable. This means once it has been constructed, no data within the 
 * instance can be changed (the static serialCounter can and should be incremented on each constructor call). 
 * From the UML diagram, note that the public constructor takes all the member variables as arguments. 
 * Data can still be read via the getter methods.
